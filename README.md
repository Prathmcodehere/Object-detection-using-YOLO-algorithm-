# Object-detection-using-YOLO-algorithm-
 Object detection is a critical capability of autonomous vehicle technology. It’s an area of computer vision that’s exploding and working so much better than just a few years ago.  YOLO is a clever convolutional neural network (CNN) for doing object detection in real-time. The algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image, and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.  YOLO is popular because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. The algorithm “only looks once” at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the neural network to make predictions
